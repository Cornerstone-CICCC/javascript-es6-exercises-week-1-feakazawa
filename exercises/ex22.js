/*
James was creating an array with the colors of the rainbow, and he forgot some colors. 
The standard rainbow colors are usually listed in this order:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"];
but James had this:

var rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
Using only the splice() method, insert the missing colors into the array, and remove the color "Blackberry" 
by following these steps:

Remove "Blackberry"
Add "Yellow" and "Green"
Add "Purple"
*/

const rainbow = ["Red", "Orange", "Blackberry", "Blue"];
rainbow.splice(2, 1);
rainbow.splice(2, 0, "Yellow");
rainbow.splice(3, 0, "Green");
rainbow.splice(rainbow.length, 0, "Purple");
console.log(rainbow);
